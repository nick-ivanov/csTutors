  "body": "### How Does It Work?\r\nThe website consists of a login page for tutors, students, and site administrators. A user will login with an existing username and password and it is validated by the database to ensure the credentials are valid. The administrator will create the username and password for each new user to the website. The “About Us” and “How it Works” pages will contain content to explain the services that are provided from the Computer Science department’s tutoring program and more information about use-cases for the entire website. Further implementation will include, a content management system, a live chat plugin, a page to allow a current student to create a new username and password and user data will be stored in an encrypted database.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@dylanparsons\r\n@kelseykeenan",
